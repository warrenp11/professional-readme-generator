## Description
This project was designed as a homework assignment for Rutgers Coding Boot Camp. We were required to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input.
  
Initial starter code was provided for this project.


>Acceptance Criteria

>>
>>WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
>>
>>THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
>>
>>WHEN I enter my project title
>>
>>THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
>>
>>WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
>>
>>THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
>>
>>WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
>>
>>THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
>>
>>WHEN I enter my GitHub username
>>
>>THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
>>
>>WHEN I enter my email address
>>
>>THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
>>

## Project Insight
This project build felt more natural for me than previous projects. And while I am grateful for the starter code which was provided to us, I feel confident that I could've completed this build without it. Getting the license badges to display presented the most difficulty.
